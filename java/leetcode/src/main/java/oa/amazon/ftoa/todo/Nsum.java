/**
 * there are n elements in a one-dimensional array where all successive elements
 * are of equal distance. There is a force associated with each element.
 * the force from that element to another imaginary point will be K/x,
 * where k is a constant and x is the distance between that element to
 * the imaginary point with direction[+ve for right-side, -ve for left-side].
 *
 * We need to find the number of neutral points we can get
 * where neutral points are defined as an imaginary point
 * where all element forces sum with that imaginary point should be 0.
 *
 * [neutral points can be a decimal value].
 * ex:[0,4]
 * here only 2 is a neutral point.
